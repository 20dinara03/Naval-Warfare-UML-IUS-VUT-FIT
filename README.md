# Naval Warfare – UML Diagrams

This project presents **UML diagrams** for a naval warfare simulation, including **pirates, ships, fleets, ports, and battles**. The model defines object-oriented relationships between different entities involved in naval operations.

## 📌 Project Overview
- **Designed using:** UML methodology
- **Concept:** Naval battles, alliances, and pirate crews
- **Key Entities:**
  - **Battle (Bitva)** – Represents naval battles with locations, casualties, and participating ships.
  - **Alliance (Aliance)** – Groups of pirate crews forming larger forces.
  - **Port (Přístav)** – Harbors for ships with specific capacities and locations.
  - **Fleet (Flotila)** – A division of multiple ships under a single commander.
  - **Ship (Loď)** – Contains attributes like type, captain, port, and capacity.
  - **Pirate (Pirat)** – Individual sailors with personal traits and actions.
  - **Crew Member (Člen posádky)** – Defines roles and responsibilities aboard a ship.
  - **Captain (Kapitán)** – Leader of a ship, able to issue orders and manage the crew.

## 🏗️ UML Diagrams Included
This project contains **four UML diagrams**, each representing different aspects of the system:

1. **Class Diagram** – Shows the structure of the system, its objects, attributes, and relationships.
2. **Use Case Diagram** – Illustrates user interactions with the system (e.g., how pirates, captains, and ports interact).
3. **Sequence Diagram** – Describes the order of operations, showing message flow between objects.
4. **State Machine Diagram** – Represents the different states of ships, battles, and alliances.

These diagrams provide a **comprehensive model** for simulating naval warfare dynamics.

- `Project.jpg` – UML class diagram for naval warfare
- `README.md` – Project documentation

## 🚀 How to Use
1. **Analyze the UML diagrams** to understand object relationships.
2. **Use the diagrams** to develop a simulation or an OOP-based system.
3. **Modify the model** to fit additional game mechanics or historical naval scenarios.
